### Project introduction. 
This project aims to bring a new optimized cooling and heating system which will has the ability to reduce energy costs due to heating and cooling by up to 40%. 

The solution created in this project is based on deep Q-Learning network technique which is a subfield of the deep learning and much developed subfield of the reinforecement learning.
